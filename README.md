# Agriculture Disease Detection
# Overview
This project aims to address the economic losses and crop waste faced by farmers due to diseases in potato plants. Using deep learning techniques, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNN), we have developed a mobile application that allows farmers to diagnose diseases in potato plants by simply taking a picture.
